This is the overall ChatGPT transcript I used for this project. Note: lots of this was never actually used, as I changed the direction of one of my
figures after having significant computer memory issues. Additionally, lots of this ChatGPT work was actually done to figure out how to use GitHub 




after running library(dorothea) library(decoupleR) human_regulons <- decoupleR::get_dorothea(levels = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')) head(human_regulons),
I get the error Error in utils::packageVersion("OmnipathR") : there is no package called ‘OmnipathR’. Am I downloading outdated packages?

Please do not provide any actual code for me, this is for my class which says we can use generative AI for guidance but we should write the code
ourselves. I have been learning in R studio all semester and am now writing in VSCode in a shared github repository for a group project. However,
I don't have experience in VSCode or github and need some help! I just uploaded a csv file into a folder within the repo (I think I did that?),
but then when I try and reference the file, VScode doesn't show anything. Even just trying to head() the file draws a blank. However, I don't
have any error messages. Can you please help me debug this?

I am reading in a data.table() and there are a few lines that are missing entries. I am currently getting an error message because of this, but
I really just want to fill those spots with NA. When I tried na.strings="NA" this didn't work

I changed the code to na.strings=c("","NA") because there are commas indicating where the NA entries should be, just no values. However, I am
getting the same error message "Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec, : line 2 did not have 4 elements"

This is what the first two lines say. From my analysis, the commas are in the correct places and there shouldn't be an issue: Broad_ID,CCLE_Name,
Aliases,COSMIC_ID,Sanger ID,Primary Disease,Subtype Disease,Gender,Source ACH-000557,AML193_HAEMATOPOIETIC_AND_LYMPHOID_TISSUE,AML-193,,,Leukemia,
,Female,ATCC

I changed the code to line_names <-read.table("data/DepMap-2018q3-celllines.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",") and got the error message "Error in
scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec, : line 248 did not have 9 elements" even though line 248 is ACH-000936,
EFO27_OVARY,EFO-27,906852,1497,Ovarian Cancer,carcinoma,Female,NIBRI

I added fill = TRUE and got this warning: In scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec, : EOF within quoted string Is this
something I need to worry about

I just went through the whole file and there are an even numbre of "

I am trying to download a package in R using this code, but the error message says devtools doesn't exist.
devtools::install_github("schochastics/networkdata") Is there another way to download this package?

Does a green line next to the line of code I am trying to run in VScode mean that the code is currently running and just taking a moment? I ran
autograph() with a large file so maybe it is just taking a while to plot

I used autograph() to quickly visualize my data (~78 genes, ~17,000 genes) because I want to create a 2D network of the genes. However, the plot
was just a straight line. Is there something wrong with the way I processed the data?

I have one dataframe with values in it. I want to add a new column to this dataframe that has numbers from another data frame in it. However,
to retrieve the numbers for this new column, I need to determine which values to pair up. This is a pseudo example very simplified. I have one
dataframe with a column containing A, B, C, D and a second column containing 1, 2, 3, 4. I have another dataframe containing B, D, A, C and a
second column containing red, purple, green, blue. I want the final data frame to have a column of A, B, C, D, a column of 1, 2, 3, 4, and a
column of green, red, blue, purple.

yes please, I would appreciate help with the logic behind SQL joins

Is there a way to approach a left join if the column name I want to join "by" has a different name in each data frame?

I ran the line cell_data_0.9_types <- left_join(cell_data_0.9, cell_modules, by = c("Members" = "Module genes")) because the first set of data
has a column named "Members" where many of the values are the same (hopefully) as the values in "Modules genes". However, I get the error Error
in left_join(): ! Join columns in y must be present in the data. ✖ Problem with Module genes.

I have two columns I want to set as equal and they contain several strings in each of the entries in the column. However, one of the columns uses
commas to separate strings within each of the entries, whereas the other column uses spaces to separate the strings within each entry. Is there
a way to have R disregard this detail?

there is no standard length for any of the entries. For example, one may be EHFD23, EHBJFD4546, EJHBFDKJ489643, and another entry within the same
column that is using commas to delimit may be FDH343, JKD6354, HJFGDS3423, FDSJKHF23432, DFD2342, KJGDS90. I think this means I can't just separate the entries

How can I standardize the columns so that neither contain commas or both contain commas?

I am currently assigning color in ggplot2 based on a vector of numbers, and this is plotting points on a bluescale. Is there a way to change the color to 
something besides blue, while still having the colors represent the vector that I feed in?

Using geom_label, is there a descriptor to put into the fill argument so that the label has a translucent background?

Please do not provide any written code for me, I just need help theoretically understanding how to approach the logic of this problem. I have databases
called hu.MAP and DoRothEA which contain pairs of genes in the human genome that interact as well as scores rating these interactions. For each of these
data sets, I am supposed to compare fold enrichment of the gene pairs in the database as compared to another database or as compared to GLS or Pearson's
values from another database. This is mostly what the paper provides as general instructions: Following the strategy of Pan et al., we compared methods by
considering their rankings on a per-gene basis. Specifically, we considered only the top N partners for each gene for N from 1 to 10, and looked at how
enrichment varied as a function of N. We used the same version of hu.MAP benchmarked in Pan et al. (that is, hu.MAP v.1). Enrichments were calculated as the
percentage of the top N gene pairs in the pathway or complex database, divided by the percentage of gene pairs found in the database. For instance, to
calculate the enrichment of COXPRESdb in hu.MAP for N = 2, we found the top two co-expressed partners per gene according to COXPRESdb (N = 2 × 15,552 gene
pairs), computed the percentage of these pairs that were part of the same hu.MAP complex, and divided by the percentage of the 15,552 × 15,552 gene pairs
that were part of the same hu.MAP complex.

I understand the theory of what I am doing, I am unsure of the steps needed to process the data to get it into the form that I am able to do these
calculations. Do I need to do matrix operations?

My DoRothEA data is currently only showing confidence in the form of a letter rather than a score, and a mode of regulation. Is there a way to convert this
into the desired score? I already have it in the form of pairwise rows

please provide citation for using ordinal ranking or published weights

my predicted, not truth values, are presented in the form of a matrix with all genes present in both dimensions. I think I need help manipulating this matrix
into a form that is similar to my other data that has the pairwise rows and each row has a score

In my matrix, the row and column names are actually included as the entries in the first row and column, making operations weird. Is there a standard way
to manipulate this?

is it concerning that the matrix that should be a symmetrical matrix is 19815 x 19816?

the original data I ran in was dim 19816 x 19817. I then ran the line coxpres_clean <- coxpres[-c(1), -c(1)] because the first row and column were the
headers and row names. However, I am still stuck with the asymmetrical data

yes, there was a blank corner cell. How do I strip this?

I just removed the top row. Dimensions are now 19815 x 19817. However, even by removing the leftmost column I will still have asymmetrical data

I just ran > subset(melt(mini_coxpres), na.rm = TRUE) because I have the upper triangle of my matrix set to NA and got the error message: Error: vector
memory limit of 16.0 Gb reached, see mem.maxVSize(). Is there a way I can streamline this so I don't run into memory issues?

When I just ran mini_coxpres <- as(coxpres_clean, "sparseMatrix"), I still ran into the memory issue

Yes please, I would appreciate help not using giant amounts of memory

To get the lower triangle, I currently do this. Can you guide me on good packages/functions that would work to go from this to triplet representation?
diag(coxpres_clean) <- 0 coxpres_clean[upper.tri(coxpres_clean, diag = TRUE)] <- NA

Won't it take a long time to run over all 320 million entries, even with an if loop saying it should skip anything with a 0 or NA in it? How long
approximately will this code take to run?

I just ran mini_coxpres <- which(!is.na(coxpres_clean), arr.ind = TRUE) and ran into the same memory error

Help, I just opened an adroit window to try and have more memory to run this but the screen that opened won't run any code, it opened up a local
vs code window not the main one I'm working on

What do I need to write to get this code to work in my standard computer without adroit? I understand the logic but don't understand the actual =
syntax that will allow it to work on my computer with the memory restraints

What do I type to do step 2?

I want to do approach #1. Would the code diag(coxpres_clean) <- NA coxpres_clean[upper.tri(coxpres_clean, diag = TRUE)]
<- NA mini_coxpres <- as(coxpres_clean, "sparseMatrix") work?

Ugh this doesn't work. still memory issues

Could you please provide me a few key lines of code that I am missing?

I am willing to write that ChatGPT provided these lines of code. Please provide lines of code and I will cite you appropriately.

I am currently running the second above. It has been running about 10 mins. How long do you expect it to take?

If I were to break it into chunks, would that cut the run time? How long would that take?

Yes please. I will cite you so I don't mind copying the exact lines so I don't hurt my computer's memory. Please also tell me what
command to type into my terminal so that I can force quit the run that is currently running.        yes please      yes please

When I ran the above code (without accounting for RAM), I got this error: Error in rbindlist(chunk_triplets) : Item 3 has 4

Where should I add the if (length(non_na_cols) > 0) { triplet_list[[i]] <- data.table( gene1 = rownames(chunk)[i],
gene2 = colnames(chunk)[non_na_cols], score = row_vals[non_na_cols] ) } else { triplet_list[[i]] <- NULL # skip empty rows } in my code?

chunk_size <- 1000 num_rows <- nrow(coxpres_clean) num_chunks <- ceiling(num_rows / chunk_size) num_cores <- detectCores() - 1 # leave 1 core free for

chunk_triplets) gc() } I have a syntax issue when I added in the "else" to skip empty rows. It doesn't like the comma after else. Please correct the syntax issue

even after all of this, I am still hitting memory limits on my computer

How long do you think it would take to run?

Yes please, then I will cite the code you provide       yes please

Based on what you know, how long should this code take to run?

After all of this I am still running into memory limits     yes please

I am planning on going to sleep soon. How should I leave my computer so that VS code continues to run and I don't acidentally shut it down

I think I have it all set up to not sleep, on a mac which settings should I check?

I have a list of genes with their classic names (ie. MYC, TP53, etc.). I am hoping to get the GO terms for these genes. Is there an R package I should use to
do this or do I need to manually look up each gene?

I have a txt file where the first 4 rows are the headers, then each row is a new cell. Every fourth entry is a new row in the overall graph. Is there a way to read this into R?

I adjusted the file so each row is one line of the data table and each entry is separated by a tab. There is a row of headers. I just ran the line annotated_genes <-
read.csv("QCB455 Figure 7.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE) but got the error Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, :
duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed

This read everything into one column, with the very first word being the column name. I need to specify that there are four columns and the entries in teh columns are separated by
tabs, whereas the rows are specificed by new lines

I just ran annotated_genes <- read_tsv("QCB455 Figure 7.txt", col_names = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = NULL, check.names = FALSE) and got the error Error in
read_tsv("QCB455 Figure 7.txt", col_names = TRUE, sep = "\t", : unused arguments (sep = "\t", row.names = NULL, check.names = FALSE)

It still read into one column. This is the spacing (there should only be tabs) Gene Tissues Function Cluster MYC Autonomic Ganglia Oncogene: DNA-binding TF, cell cycle 1 TAF5L
Central Nervous System DNA-binding TF, promoter TATA 1 EP300 Lung, Pancreas Tumor Suppressor: histone acetyltransferase 2 TADA2B Kidney Transcription activation 2

When I ran readLines, I got ] "Gene" "\tTissues" "\tFunction"

This is the output: "Gene" Warning message: In readLines("QCB455 Figure 7.txt") : incomplete final line found on 'QCB455 Figure 7.txt'

I'm running this code but the title continues to not show up although the x and y axis labels do, and I am unable to read the X axis individual gene labels because they are
horizontal and overlap. How can I rotate the labels so that they are at 45* angles? ggplot(data = overall_genes, aes(x = genes)) + geom_bar() + labs(main = "Genes Most
Highly Co-Expressed Across Cancer Types", x = "Genes", y = "Count")

I just got this error when trying to push and pull changes to vs code through git hub. This is the erorr at the last step where I try to sync my changes: Git: RPC failed;

How do I deleete if I accidentally tried to push a large file?

(base) ~/Desktop/qcb455_final_proj> git status On branch Charlotte Your branch is ahead of 'origin/Charlotte' by 2 commits. (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

I don't like using the terminal. Is there a way to do this through the vs code interface or the github interface?

I think I have pushed the failure before, but in the Git website it doesn't showq any of the files I think are problematic. Additionally, could this be caused because
I removed my gitignore file in the branch and also deleted several of the files I had in my branch in VS code?

I ran git pull --no-rebase and got this message in my terminal Merge branch 'Charlotte' of https://github.com/jchen2140/qcb455_final_proj into Charlotte # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is
necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Type :qa! and press <Enter> to abandon
all changes and exit Vim

Its not letting me type anything in the terminal
